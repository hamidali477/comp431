HW 2 NOTES
**********
-Goal is to parse SMTP "RCPT TO" and "DATA" commands

-Specify how you will handle sequencing errors in state-machine (restart, ignore, etc.)
	MAIL FROM: <kajsdf@blah.com>
	RCPT TO: <ahfh@balah.ocm>
	MAIL FROM: <kajhf@kaj.com>    ----> Sequencing error here. (just restart it OR wait for correct command, in this case DATA)
	DATA
	...
	.

-Process commands indefinitely until "end of file"

-Syntax error takes precedence over out-of-order, out-of-order precedence over parameter errors
